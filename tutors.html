        <h1 id="mission">Mission Statement</h1>
        <p>We began this initiative in order to help education diffuse throughout underrepresented regions of the world. As you may know, children particularly responded to the pandemic with haste, for better or for worse. They were subjected to 8-hour online Zoom classes which negatively affected their eyes, their education (a child cannot sit at a screen paying attention for 8 hours in a day), and their cognitive health (are children really sustaining the knowledge learnt through online classes?). Therefore, this international organization, comprised of four main members and counting, hopes to provide tutoring services with personalized meetings and lesson plans for each student we encounter. Please contact each of us through our interest form and prospective emails, and we hope to provide engaging, educational facilities from your learner soon!</p>

      <h1>Stanford Study on Distant Learning</h1>
      <img src="" alt="">
      <p>A new Stanford study has documented that distance learning harmed the reading skills at the elementary school level. Researchers at Stanford's Graduate School of Education say reading fluency suffered dramatically, especially among second and third-grade students. </p>

          <h1>Student Example</h1>
          <p>Dhruv's mother just finished explaining to his teacher that he was unable to attend class yesterday due to issues with internet connectivity. She also tried to convince the teacher to give him an extra day to finish the assignments allotted that day. The teacher understood that, like many of her students, Dhruv too has been struggling to adapt to the new form of learning. As someone who is always excited about classes, the recent reluctance to attend online classes on Dhruv's part was a cause of concern for his parents and teachers. Dhruv was used to studying amongst peers and in a familiar environment that promoted learning. An active student in the classroom, his participation and willingness to answer during class went down when studying online. The lack of one-on-one interaction with his teachers also left him with more doubts, and he struggled to finish his schoolwork.</p>
