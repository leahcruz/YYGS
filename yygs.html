          <h1 id="mission">Mission Statement</h1>
          <p>We began this initiative in order to help education diffuse throughout underrepresented regions of the world. As you may know, children particularly responded to the pandemic with haste, for better or for worse. They were subjected to 8-hour online Zoom classes which negatively affected their eyes, their education (a child cannot sit at a screen paying attention for 8 hours in a day), and their cognitive health (are children really sustaining the knowledge learnt through online classes?). Therefore, this international organization, comprised of four main members and counting, hopes to provide tutoring services with personalized meetings and lesson plans for each student we encounter. Please contact each of us through our interest form and prospective emails, and we hope to provide engaging, educational facilities from your learner soon!</p>
