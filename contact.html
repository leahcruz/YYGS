        <p class="title">Founder</p>
        <p>Hello! My name is Hadi Quran, and I am a rising junior from Al-Bireh, Palestine. I can speak both English and Arabic, and I’m fluent in both. The subjects I specialize in are math, physics, sciences, computer science, and Arabic. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, playing video games, and playing the classical guitar. So feel free to talk to me about music or any other subject. I hope to achieve a simple, more accessible form of tutoring online for anyone who needs it. Making the pandemic as effortless and straightforward is what we strive for as a group. If you have any questions, you can contact me! I hope we have a great time together. </p>
